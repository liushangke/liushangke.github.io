## About Me

I'm a <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/" target="_blank"> ECE</a> MS student at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank"> Northwestern University</a>'s <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">  Mccormick School of Engineering</a>,
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/affiliated/cooper-lee.html" target="_blank"> Lee Cooper </a>and Prof.<a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/katsaggelos-aggelos.html" target="_blank"> Aggelos Katsaggelos</a>. My research involves developing computational models that cater to radiology and pathology data

<!-- In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems.  -->
Prior to joining the Master of Science program, I completed my BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering program from <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk" target = "_blank"> University of Glasgow</a>  and my BEng in Electronic Information Engineering from <a href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a>. 

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

Outside of academia, I began my football(soccer) journey as a student athelete in middle school and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.
